//! B1 — load an eApp, resolve its framework imports, and trace every call it makes.
//!
//! The whole point of this stage is the **call trace**: the eApp header advertises ~98 imports,
//! but nobody knows how many a real game actually touches. Wiring every import to a distinct trap
//! address and logging arrivals answers that empirically instead of by guesswork, and the answer
//! is what sizes the rest of the project.
//!
//! How import resolution works, and why traps are faithful rather than a hack: each import is a
//! `ldr pc, [pc, #imm]` thunk whose literal slot RetailOS patches at load time. We patch the same
//! slot — with an address in a region that holds no code. When the game calls the import, the
//! thunk loads our address into `PC` exactly as it would load the real one, and the runner
//! notices `PC` landed in trap space. Nothing is special-cased in the CPU.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------- snapshot

/// Save and restore a whole running machine.
///
/// The point is iteration cost. Every experiment re-runs the boot from reset, and reaching the
/// interesting part of a RetailOS or bootloader run costs a billion-plus instructions — two minutes,
/// paid again for every question. Snapshotting once and resuming turns that into seconds, which is
/// what makes an oracle-style sweep (vary one input, classify the outcome) practical at all.
///
/// **What is saved:** CPU including banked registers, every memory region, the alias and
/// read-override tables, the microsecond clock **and the sleep accumulator behind it**, interrupt
/// state, timer deadlines, and the ATA and BCM device models.
///
/// # The clock is two numbers, and saving one of them was a 44-minute jump backwards
///
/// `usec` is not stored state — it is *recomputed* every instruction as
/// `executed / instr_per_usec + slept_usec`. Version 3 of this format saved `usec` and not
/// `slept_usec`, so a restored machine kept the right clock for exactly zero instructions: the first
/// one recomputed it against a `slept_usec` of 0 and the clock fell back to whatever the instruction
/// count alone implied. On the standard idle snapshot that was **2 940 704 453 µs → 321 777 002 µs,
/// a backwards jump of 44 minutes of simulated time**, and firmware that measures an interval as
/// `now - start` in unsigned microseconds does not see a negative number: it sees that pair wrap to
/// **+1 676 039 845 µs, twenty-eight minutes of elapsed time**, arriving in one instruction. Every
/// timeout in RetailOS is therefore expired at the moment of restore. See research/10 Addendum 31.
///
/// Saving `slept_usec` makes the recomputation reproduce the saved `usec` exactly, because the
/// identity above is the same one the run loop maintains. The magic is `IPODSNP4`: a version-3
/// snapshot is **refused**, not read with a zero in the new field, because reading it would restore
/// precisely the machine this paragraph exists to stop existing.
///
/// **What is deliberately not saved**, because a restored run should not inherit a half-written
/// measurement: the profile, call log, unmapped map, region counters and every device log. A
/// restored run measures itself. The ATA *backing file* is not saved either — it is reopened by
/// path, so a snapshot is only valid against the same disk image.
///
/// **The click wheel is not saved**, and that has a consequence worth stating rather than
/// discovering: a restored run replays its injected script from the first step, against a machine
/// that is already past the instruction counts those steps are anchored to — so every step fires at
/// once, on the first tick. `--restore` and `--wheel` are not usefully combined until the script is
/// re-anchored; the injection is meant for a run from reset.
